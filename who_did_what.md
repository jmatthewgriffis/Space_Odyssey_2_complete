WHO DID WHAT?

Matt:
<br>-Created the galaxy (star/debris field) using recursion/fractals/branching
<br>-Created the enemy appearance using recursion/fractals/branching
<br>-Created the spaceships mobility
<br>-Created the bullet system
<br>-Created the second program that allows other controllers to connect using OSC
<br>-Created the different screen stages
<br>-Created the health system for both ships and enemy
<br>-Implemented all the physics - ship collision, bullet impact, bullet recoil
<br>-Implemented rotation of ships based on their movement
<br>-Made the game extremely difficult!!!!


Mauricio:
<br>-Ported (most of the) original code from the Processing version
<br>-Coded the enemy behavior
<br>-Used fbo wizardry to convert enemy into frame-based animation to optimize performance (was previously drawn dynamically with processor-heavy recursion)
<br>-Created two separete apps to store the recursion code and generate them as sequence of images
<br>-Made the title screen graphic
<br>-Made the ship graphics
<br>-Implemented all the graphics and graphics behavior for the assets. Making sure they would load cohesively with the controlelrs manipulation
<br>-Implemented steering for elements in the second background - Still in development, not currently drawn in the app.
