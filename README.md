NOTE: this repo replaces another, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jmatthewgriffis/Space_Odyssey_2_-OLD_REPO-">found here</a>. It was necessary to create a new repo because the original was created to hold only a single app and the project eventually expanded to include additional apps and other files. Most of the history of the project can be viewed in the older repo.

----------

Space Odyssey 2 was and is created by me, J. Matthew Griffis, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sheva29">Mauricio Sanchez-Duque</a>, as a collaborative final project for:

Parsons MFA Design and Technology - 
Fall 2013 semester - 
Algorithmic Animation

My other work for that class can be <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jmatthewgriffis/griffis_algo2013">found here</a>;
Mauricio's can be <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sheva29/sanchez-duque_algo2013">found here</a>.
